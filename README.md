## Deployment information

1. Preparation
   - Install `nvm`\
     Linux, OSX: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm \
     Windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
   - Install `Node.js` _Recommended For Most Users_ version (12.18.4 for now) using nvm \
     Linux, OSX: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage \
     Windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#usage
     ```
     nvm install 12.18.4
     nvm use 12.18.4
     ```
   - Install `aws-cli` version 2 \
     Linux: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html \
     Windows: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html \
     OSX: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-mac.html
   - Install `Serverless framework` globally via npm \
     https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/
     ```
     npm install -g serverless
     ```
   - Create AWS user with at least programmatic access. It will be better to use a user with the Admin access. Download
     user's credentials.\
     Set up `AWS credentials` according to `Serverless framework` documentation. \
     Name the profile as it named in the `env.yml -> PROFILE` field. \
     https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/config-credentials/
     ```
     serverless config credentials --provider aws --key ACCESS_KEY_ID --secret SECRET_ACCESS_KEY --profile PROFILE
     ```
   - Install `git` https://git-scm.com/downloads
   - If the repository is private you should set up SSH key or use HTTPS for cloning it
   - Clone the repository
   - Install node_modules running the command in the root of the project
     ```
     npm i
     ```
2. Set up environment variables

   - Open env.yml file, you can see stage sections here. For example, `local`, `dev`, and `prod`. If you deploy on
     production use `prod` section and do not touch other sections.
   - Input your AWS region, for example, `us-east-1`
   - Go to AWS Console `Key Management Service` and create Symmetric key in your region
   - In the root folder of the project create kms_key.yml file and copy your key (Key ID) here like
     ```
     key: your_key_here
     ```
   - You can add any environment variables. If you need to secure them, encrypt them.
   - Copy the value of variable and run the command in the root of the project
     ```
     sls env --attribute VARIABLE_NAME --value variable_value --stage your_stage --encrypt
     
     ```
   - If you use some common variables, like

     ```yaml
     common: &common
       REGION: us-east-1
       PROFILE: default
       CLIENT: FLO

     local:
       <<: *common
     ```
TOKEN_KEY: '1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h'

     The plugin will add this variables to all stages, but we don't want it. So after encrypting, copy encrypted value
     of the new variable, revert changes and paste it to the right place.

   - You are ready for deploying

3. Deploy
   - Run the command in the root of the project
     ```
     npm run deploy:your_stage
     ```

### The project contains:

- The Media Info feature that uses mediainfo binary file and returns media info by url
- Examples of offline plugins and docker-compose file for working with AWS resources offline
- Examples of HTTP API and REST API endpoints with authorizers
- Examples of IAM Role Statements
- Example of different AWS resources
- Examples of models for dynamoose library
- Examples of models for sequelize library

- Simple CircleCI configuration

### Project structure

- .circleci - Configuration for CI/CD
- api - Code of the features or CRUD operations of entities
  - feature_name - Code of one feature or CRUD operations of one entity. It should cover the area of one
    responsibility. For example, Media Info feature, CRUD operations (create, remove, update, delete) for user entity
    - handler.ts - This is a handler file. It should contain Lambda functions for one feature. For example, Media
      Info feature or CRUD operations for the user entity.
    - feature_name.manager.ts - It's the feature manager. Its methods should implement some feature's functionality
    - feature_name.service.ts - It's the feature service. Its methods should implement one of the main steps of some
      feature's functionality
    - feature_name.interface.ts - This file should contain all required interfaces for the feature
- bin - Executable files (third party libraries that can be used inside a Lambda function)
- errors/ - Base collections of errors to use in lambda
- helper - All auxiliary code
  - http-api/ - Helpers for HTTP API
  - rest-api/ - Helpers for REST API
  - app-errors.ts - This file contains the class that derives from Node.js Error class. It should be used for
    providing custom errors with the proper structure
  - base-error-handler.ts - Base for building error handlers. Normally you should not use it in lambda.
  - helper.ts - This file contains auxiliary functions
  - logger.ts - This file contains log function that helps log data in the proper way
- models - Models for the databases
  - user.model.ts
  - job.model.ts
- serverless - YAML files for description Serverless resources
  - functions - YAML files for description Lambda function with their triggers
    - FeatureName.yml - YAML file for description Lambda functions with their triggers for one feature
  - resources - YAML files for description resources like S3 buckets, SQS, DynamoDB tables, etc.
    - APIGateway.yml
    - Buckets.yml
    - ElasticSearch.yml
    - SQS.yml
    - Tables.yml
- services - Classes for working with third party libraries, APIs, services, etc.
  - cloud-formation.service.ts
  - email.service.ts
  - s3.service.ts
- env.yml - Environment variables
- package.json
- README.md
- serverless.yml - Contains the main description of the service
- webpack.config.json
- sonar-project.properties - Contains the configuration for static code analysis

## Static code analysis

- Start SonarQube docker container with command `npm run sonarqube:up`
- Start tests with command `npm run test`
- Start analysis with command `npm run sonarqube-verify`
- Go to http://localhost:9000
- Log in with _admin/admin_ credentials
- Now you can see the project's report

### Troubleshooting

- If you see the error `Not authorized. Analyzing this project requires authentication. Please provide a user token in sonar.login or other credentials in sonar.login and sonar.password.`,
  go to the `Administration` menu in the header -> `Security` -> scroll down and turn off `Force user authentication`.
  Do it for local usage only!

## How to add evn variable

In project used https://github.com/org-redtea/serverless-env-generator that fork of https://github.com/DieProduktMacher/serverless-env-generator.

Some caveats:

- Shorthand `-v` does not work for both original plugin and forked.
- Shorthand `-c` does not work

Add kms_key.yml file with `${stage}` field and your KMS Id to the root.
For example:

```YAML
local: xxx
dev: xxx
test: xxx
prod: xxx
```

### In short:

#### Viewing environment variables

Use the following commands to read and decrypt variables from your YAML environment files:

#### List variables

```sh
serverless env
serverless env --stage $STAGE
```

#### View one variable

```sh
serverless env --attribute $NAME
serverless env --attribute $NAME --stage $STAGE

#shorthand:
sls env -a $NAME
sls env -a $NAME -s $STAGE
```

#### Decrypt variables

```sh
serverless env --decrypt
serverless env --attribute $NAME --decrypt
serverless env --attribute $NAME --stage $STAGE --decrypt

#shorthand:
sls env -a $NAME --decrypt
sls env -a $NAME -s $STAGE -d
```

#### Setting environment variables

Use the following commands to store and encrypt variables in your YAML environment files:

Note that variables are stored to the first file listed in _envFiles_.

#### Set a variable

```sh
serverless env --attribute $NAME --value $PLAINTEXT
serverless env --attribute $NAME --value $PLAINTEXT --stage $STAGE

#shorthand:
sls env -a $NAME --value $PLAINTEXT
sls env -a $NAME --value $PLAINTEXT --s $STAGE
```

#### Set and encrypt a variable

```sh
serverless env --attribute $NAME --value $PLAINTEXT --encrypt
serverless env --attribute $NAME --value $PLAINTEXT --stage $STAGE --encrypt

#shorthand:
sls env -a $NAME --value $PLAINTEXT -e
sls env -a $NAME --value $PLAINTEXT -s $STAGE -e
```

#### Set value of attribute in anchor

```sh
serverless env --anchor $ANHOR --attribute $NAME --value $PLAINTEXT

#shorthand:
sls env --anchor $ANHOR -a $NAME --value $PLAINTEXT
```

Let\`s assume we have the following `env.yml`:

```YAML
common:
  &common
  VAR: "1"

local:
  <<: *common
dev:
  <<: *common

test:
  <<: *common

prod:
  <<: *common
```

The result of the command:

```bash
$ sls env --attribute VAR --anchor common --value 2
```

will be:

```YAML
common:
  &common
  VAR: "2"

local:
  <<: *common
dev:
  <<: *common

test:
  <<: *common

prod:
  <<: *common
```


## FAQ

### What type of API Gateway event to use for lambda: REST API or HTTP API?

In most cases HTTP API is the best and cheapest choice. So, use it. 
In other cases you should check [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-vs-rest.html) to find out what to choose. There are a lot of differences between HTTP API and REST API.

- About REST API event in serverless docs. [Link](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/). 
- About HTTP API event in serverless docs. [Link](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api/)

### "Serverless Offline only supports retrieving JWT from the headers (undefined)" error when trying to start offline

Probably, you use lambda authorizer for HTTP API. Serverless offline plugin does not support for that yet. Check the plugin repo for any updates.
